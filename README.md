# semi-file_endecryption
File En/Decryption as a Java Web Application using Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

Simple Java Application to understand file Up/Download concept and Advanced Encryption Standards.

For all beginners, this is perfect repository to start-off with a java web application describing File En/Decryption in simple manner. I have used <input type="file"> tag for selecting file from local computer. I have used Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you have to run the application on any Web Browser. On the Home Page, you will be asked to select en/decryption, file to be uploaded and secret key. Once file is uploaded successfully and en/decryption is done, one can easily download file using hyperlink.

NOTE: - For En/Decryption of file, I have used AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding as Cipher Algorithm.
